# Requirements

🎯 Created using create-next-app

🎯 Design a SQL schema for a posts table, and a comments table that has a post_id column connecting it to the posts table.

🎯 Either create a form where users can add posts OR seed your database with at least 4 posts that comments can be added to (if you do the seed, one of the stretch goals will be harder).

🎯 Add a form to the individual post page to allow creating a new comment, which is saved to the new comments table including the Post ID.

🎯 Refresh the /posts route data when adding a new post, and redirect the user to the list of posts

🎯 Refresh the /post/:postId route when adding a new comment, so the new comment is displayed on the page

🎯 Add static and dynamic metadata to your pages
