# Set-up your database

## STEP 1: PLAN your tables

- Think about how many tables you need
  - Possibly two? One for posts, one for categories?
- How do I connect the tables? Is it many-to-many (junction table) or one-to-many relationships (my advice is that you have one category for many posts) ?
- Visually draw your tables on Figma, DrawSQL, or paper!

## STEP 2: Write the SQL queries to create your tables and seed the data

## STEP 3: Connect your tables to the server
