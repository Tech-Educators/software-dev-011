//This is the first page the user will see â€“ the root
//It can be the same as App!

//Routing help!
//I wrapped my App in main.jsx with Browser Router
//I will build my routes in the root component (App or Home)

//Routes should wrap your Route
//Route has two attributes --> path, for your params; and element, for the component you want to render in that path
//For user navigation, separately, you will have Link components
//The Link component has an attribute called to="" to specify the params we are navigating to
